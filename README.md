# Rotate
Rotate is an Atari 8-bit program written in 6502 assembly language that rotates a wireframe cube

I originally wrote this around 1983 while at Purdue University.  I used MAC/65 on my Atari 400.  At the time I had an 810 disk drive.  Eventually after I graduated from Purdue I purchased an 800xl and a 1050 drive.
I found my original listing I printed out at Purdue and entered it into MAC/65 using the Altirra emulator.  I then decided to paste it into the WUDSN IDE and build it via the MADS assembler.
